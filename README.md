# Flowifyâœ¨

## Overview

Flowify is a powerful workflow builder designed to simplify complex Spotify playlist generation. By Using [React Flow](https://reactflow.dev/) as the workflow builder, [bull-mq](https://github.com/taskforcesh/bullmq) for queuing, [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for components, [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team/) as ORM, and [Planetscale](https://planetscale.com/) for the database.

Flowify is heavily inspired by [SmarterPlaylists](https://github.com/plamere/SmarterPlaylists) and [Goofy](https://github.com/Chimildic/goofy). Flowify aims to provide a modern and intuitive alternative to SmarterPlaylists, while also providing a more flexible and powerful alternative to Goofy.
