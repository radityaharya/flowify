# Flowifyâœ¨

Flowify is currently under development. Do not use it with your Primary Spotify account as it may cause data loss.

## Overview

Flowify is a drag-and-drop environment for creating Spotify playlist generation workflows. With Flowify, you can create custom workflows to generate playlists based on your Spotify library, liked tracks, and recommendations. Flowify is built with [React Flow](https://reactflow.dev/) as the workflow builder, [bull-mq](https://github.com/taskforcesh/bullmq) for queuing, [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for components, [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team/) as ORM

Flowify is heavily inspired by [SmarterPlaylists](https://github.com/plamere/SmarterPlaylists) and [Goofy](https://github.com/Chimildic/goofy). Flowify aims to provide a modern and intuitive alternative to SmarterPlaylists, while also providing a more flexible and powerful alternative to Goofy.

## Running Locally

To get started with Flowify, follow these steps:

1. **Installation:**

   ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/radityaharya/flowify
   ```

   ```bash
     cd flowify
   ```

   ```bash
     npm install
   ```

2. **Run Redis:**
   Start a Redis server. You can download and install Redis from the [official website](https://redis.io/). Alternatively, you can use a cloud service such as [Railway](https://docs.railway.app/guides/redis) or [Upstash](https://upstash.com/). Redis is used for queueing and caching.

3. **Set Up Database:**
    Create a Postgres database and set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable. You can use a local Postgres instance or a cloud service such as [Neon](https://neon.tech/). Flowify uses [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team/) as the ORM.

4. **Set Up Spotify API:**
   Create a Spotify developer account and create a new application. You can find instructions on how to do this [here](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/concepts/apps). Keep the client ID and client secret handy.

5. **Set Up Environment Variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following variables:

   | Variable              | Description                        |
   | --------------------- | -----------------------------------|
   | DATABASE_URL          | Postgres connection string         |
   | NEXTAUTH_SECRET       | NextAuth secret key                |
   | NEXTAUTH_URL          | NextAuth application URL           |
   | SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID     | Spotify API client ID              |
   | SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET | Spotify API client secret          |
   | REDIS_URL             | Redis connection URL               |
   | NO_WORKER             | Disables built-in workflow runner  |

6. **Push the schema to your database:**

   ```bash
   npm run db:push
   ```

7. **Run the Application:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

8. **Open Flowify:**
   Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
